Backlog
-------

Here's some more things on our list that we haven't scheduled yet:

* **History and Audit service:** History view with advanced search over years worth of execution
  records, over multiple versions of continuously upgraded |st2|.
* **At-scale refinements:** Ensure event handling reliability, and event storm resilience. Complete
  support for multi-node deployment of sensor containers and rules engines for resilience and
  throughput.
* **RHEL 8.x:** Support RHEL/CentOS 8.x when it is released. Drop RHEL 6.x at that time.
* **DB/Filesystem Consistency:** Provide better tooling for managing consistency between database and
  filesystem consistency for rules, actions, sensors, etc.
* **Configurable Sensors:** Run multiple instances of the same sensor, with different configurations.
* **Pack Dependency:** Better automatic handling of pack dependencies.
* **Python 3:** Complete Python 3 support. We are progressively updating code and adding support, but
  do not yet have a final date for when everything can run via Python 3.
* **RBACv2:**

  * **Filters**: Tag and property based filters, more refined and convenient access control.
  * **Permissions**: Permissions on key value objects, arbitrary triggers, support for a default role.
