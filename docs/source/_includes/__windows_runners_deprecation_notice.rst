.. note::

    Windows runners are DEPRECATED as of version ``2.9``. These runners are replaced
    by :ref:`WinRM Runners <ref-winrm-runners>` which use a native Python implementation
    of the WinRM protocol. Please migrate all existing actions over to these new runners. Any new
    code should prefer WinRM Runners over the Windows Runners.

    The legacy Windows runners will be REMOVED in version ``3.1``.
